# Breakout-CS
An exploration into C# and Windows Forms

This project was created to show that I can program in C#. Additionally, it let me explore Windows Forms. However, I used
Windows Forms in a way that's not exactly intended. I learned that object collisions are not as intuitive as I originally thought.
Making games interests me but this experience showed me that it's a lot easier to use a game engine.
